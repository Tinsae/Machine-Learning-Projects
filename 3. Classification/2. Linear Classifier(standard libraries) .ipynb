    "\n",
    "The goal of this first notebook is to explore logistic regression and feature engineering with existing Scikit-Learn functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use product review data from Amazon.com to predict whether the sentiments about a product (from its reviews) are positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Pandas to do some feature engineering\n",
    "* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.\n",
    "* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.\n",
    "* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.\n",
    "* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the **accuracy** of the model.\n",
    "* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.\n",
    "* Compare multiple logistic regression models.\n",
